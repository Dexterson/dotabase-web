# Dotabase Web

**Note:** This version of dotabase-web is still in beta, many features are missing, and some things might look ugly.

A web interface to experiment with and show the functionality of my [Dotabase](https://github.com/mdiller/dotabase "Dotabase") project. It is composed of a few web apps and pages showing information about the game Dota 2. This is the new and improved version of dotabase-web, built on React. The [old version](https://github.com/mdiller/old-dotabase-web "OldDotabaseWeb") was built using php and eventually became a pain to maintain and add to.
